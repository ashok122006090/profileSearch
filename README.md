# User Profile Search â€“ Spring Boot + Angular Application

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack application that enables free-text search over user profiles based on attributes like First Name, Last Name, Email, SSN, and more. Data is fetched from https://dummyjson.com/users and stored locally using SQLite (with optional H2 support for quick testing). The UI is built with Angular and supports sorting, filtering, and global search entirely on the client side.
